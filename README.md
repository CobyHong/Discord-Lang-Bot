> Easy and fast commands for back and forth language translations in Discord chats. Using discord.py and googletrans API. Hosted on Heroku. Chat with people with differing dialects in a manner that feels natural. Both parties will be able to communicate with ease thanks to googletran's ability to detect and translate any written language.
